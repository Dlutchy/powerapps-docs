## Image URL

 ```{0}/Image/download.aspx?entity={1}&attribute={2}&id={3}``` 

0 – Portal url

1 – entity logical name

2 – column logical name

3 – image ID

## Liquid

Developers can design the website by using Liquid code to retrieve the records from Dataverse tables. Image column values can be fetched while data being queried by using fetchXML and entity view

```
    {% for item in tables.results.entities %}
        {{ item.columnname.Type }}
        {{ item.columnname.Size }}
        {{ item.columnname.Url }}
        {{ item.columnname.Value }}
    {% endfor %}
```
| | |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Type  | Mime type of the image       |
| Size  | Image size in bytes          |
| Value | Image value in base64 string |
| Url   | Image url                    |

### Example: Retrieve default contact image

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have configured the appropriate table permissions on the contact table to read the record.

```
    {% fetchxml contacts %}
        <fetch version="1.0" output-format="xml-platform" mapping="logical" distinct="false">
            <entity name="contact">
                <attribute name="fullname">
                <attribute name="entityimage">
            </entity>
        </fetch>
    {% endfetchxml %}

    {% for item in contacts.results.entities %}
        {
            "Full Name":"{{ item.fullname }}"
            "Entity Image Url":"{{ item.entityimage.Url}}",
            "Entity Image Size":"{{ item.entityimage.Size}}",
            "Entity Image Type":"{{ item.entityimage.Type}}",
            "Entity Image Value":"{{ item.entityimage.Value}}"
        }
    {% endfor %}
```


## Web API

The [portals Web API](../web-api-overview.md) can be used to perform, create, read, update, and delete operations on image columns across Dataverse tables.

## Retrieving image data

To download thumbnail image data, use following APIs

```
    GET /_api/<entity-type>(id)/<image-attribute-name>/$value
```

Image data transfers from the web service endpoints are limited to a maximum of 16-MB data in a single service call.

### Example: Thumbnail download

#### Request

**HTTP** 
```
    GET [Portal Url]/_api/accounts(62d53214-9dfa-eb11-94ee-0022482230a8)/entityimage/$value
    
    Headers:
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream
``` 

#### Response

**HTTP**
```
    204 No Content
    
    Body:
    Byte[ ]
```

## Upload image data

To upload the images, set the value of the image column to a byte array that contains the content of the image file:

```
    PUT or PATCH /_api<entity-type>(id)/<image-attribute-name>
```

### Example: image upload

#### Request

```
    PUT [Portal Url]/_api/accounts(62d53214-9dfa-eb11-94ee-0022482230a8)/entityimage

    Headers:
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream
    
    Body :
    Byte [ ]
```
